Questions and answers

1. 	Have you worked on any any critical issue (P1)?
	Yeah we had a critical issue that was Refresh task went on pending state it didn't process Leaver Life Cycle Events.
	How did you resolve that ?
	I have run the Refresh task for single users with options 
	process events enabled and 
	provisioining assignments enabled
	
2. 	Have you worked on any any Challenging issue?
	When an employee was trying to login to sailpoint account, he recevied error message - multiple accounts found with user name.
	How did you resolve that ?
	In our Environment, Passthrough Acuthentication enabled with Active Directory Application.
	At the same Application we have multiple "Authentication Search Attributes" present so AD is returing multiple accounts. 
	We have kept only one authentication search attribute and removed other attributes.
	
	sailpoint                   Active Directory
	user - 209001				209001
	pass - admin123				Vij@y123
	
3. What are your responsibilites?
	My Respobiilites are Application Health Monitoring like SailPoint Tasks are executing successfully or not?
	Test connections for all applications working or not?
	Leaver and Joiner Life cycle events are executing or not?
	Working on End user requests like setting proper work groups access, creation of SailPoint Roles and Reports Generation.
	Finally - make sure application is up and working smoothly 
	

2. 	What is SLA (Service Level Aggrement)?
	If we can't resolve ticket within specified time that is called SLA Breech.
3.	What is SLA Time for different tickets.
	In our organisation We have to 
	close P1 Tickets within 3 hours
	close P2 Tickets within 10 hours
	close P3 Tickets within 1-2 Days
	close P4 Tickets within 3-4 Days

==================================================================================
Life Cycle Events

We have different types of life cycle events
-we have joiner life cycle event
-we have mover life cycle event
-we have leaver life cycle event


-We have joiner life cycle event, It will trigger when user joins in the organisation
-We have mover life cycle event, It will trigger when user transfer b/w departments organisation
-We have leaver life cycle event, It will trigger when user offboards in the organisation

----------------------------
For example  - Joiner
-When user joins in the organisation.
-When refresh Identity cube executes, It will trigger Joiner life cycle event. In Joiner Life Cycle event we configured joiner workflow.
-When joiner life cycle event triggers, this workflow will execute and creates Active Directory account in our organisaiton.


-------------------------------------------------
For example  - Leaver
-When user leaves in the organisation.
-When refresh Identity cube executes, It will trigger leaver life cycle event. In leaver Life Cycle event we configured leaver workflow.
-When leaver life cycle event triggers, this workflow will execute and disables accounts(Active Directory, SalesForce).

-------------------------------------------------

For example  - Mover
-When we have change in users department.
-When refresh Identity cube executes, It will trigger mover life cycle event. In mover Life Cycle event we configured mover workflow.
-When mover life cycle event triggers, this workflow will remove access and add extra access as defined in mover workflow.

--------------------------------------------------
To Trigger LIfe cycle events 
We have to enable Process Events
and 
Provision assignments in Refresh Identity Cube
