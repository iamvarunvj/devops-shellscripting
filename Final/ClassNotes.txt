Application onboarding
-----------------------
 Adding Different End Applications or Target System with IdentityIQ is called Application onboarding.
 or 
 Integrating Identity IQ with different Target Systems or End Applications is called application onboarding.
 
 
 --> Two steps while onboarding(integrating) any application with Sailpoint IdentityIQ.
		1. Creating Application definition  - It has application meta data and Schema details 
		2. Aggregation - It aggregates account data into Sailpoint IdentityIQ.(It is furhtur 2 types. Account Aggregation and Account Group Aggregation)
		
	

OOTB
Full form - Out Of The Box
The default configuration of the product is called OOTB Settings.

what is customisation?
When we overide OOTB configuration with our changes is called Customization.
	
connector ?

A connector is a software component used to connect to the target system.
Ex: Delimited file connector, JDBC (java Database connectivity), Workday Connector, ACtive DIrectory, etc
We have around 70+ connnectors in SailPoint idnetityIQ.

Connector Types
---------------
1. Not well Defined Connector
	Delimited connector , JDBC Connector, etc ............... 
	-Schema is Empty - we have to manually create schema
	-Provisioning Frame work - doesn't support. we have to mange manually 
2. Well Defined connector
	Active Directory, LDAP, Workday,OpenLDAP - Direct etc...... 
	-Schema comes by default
	-Provisioning Frame work by default
	
	
 What is Aggregation and Provisioning
 ------------------------------------
 Aggregation = Data Flow ---->End Applications ----> Sailpoint IdentityIQ
 
 Provisioning = Data Flow ---->Sailpoint IdentityIQ ----> End Applications
 
 
 Two Types of Applications
 -------------------------
 1. Authoritative Applications                         2. Non Authoritative Applications
    -Any App entire organisation data. 					  -Organisational users accounts
	-Example: PeopleSoft Database							Example: CSV files (Financial Application)
			  CSV Files												 Active Directory
			  Workday Application									 PayRoll Application
																	 
																	 
																	 
																	 

	
	------------------------------------
	
How to UP Tomcat Server?
	Go to installation directory?
	run tomcat8w file at following location
	E:\Apps\Tomcat 8.5\bin
	click on start button.
	else
	Open Services application
	click on run


Schema
1. Account Schema 2. Group Schema

1. Account Schema : list of attributes which represents user accout is called Account Schema
2. Group Schema : list of attributes which represents group is called Group Schema 

Aggregation
1. Account Aggregation : The process of loading accounts information is called Account aggregation.
2. Group Aggregation : The process of loading groups information is called Group aggregation.

	When "Managed" is specified on Schema,  that item will be pushed into Entitlement Catalog section.
	When "Entitlement" is specified on Schema,  that item will be pushed to Identity Cube's Entitlements Tab. 
	then we can used it for Certification and for other uses.


Entitlement: SEt of permissons on the target system is called entitlement.


what is multivalued in schema?
Ans: If one of the schme attributes is holding multiple values, then that attributed will be marked as multivalued.  
what is managed in schema?
Ans: when an attribute is marked as the Managed in the application schema then that attribute will be promoted into Entitlement Catalog section.
what is Entitlement in schema?
Ans: when an attribute is marked as the Entitlement in the application schema then that attribute will be promoted to Identity cube's Entitlement Tab. 
This we can use in different areas of SailPoint IIQ. For example we can certify these entitlements.


Rules is all about Coding 
we do write in Beanshell scripting 
what is Beanshell scripting 
this is Leightweight language, alomst similar to core java.(almost 95%)


Extended IdentityAttributes Creation 

Global Settings>Identity Mappings > Add new Attribute>Define mapping
1. From debug page Configuration Objects>UIConfig-- identityViewAttributes 


Financials application onboarding
	
What is Correlation?
-------------------------
Attaching users accounts to the existing identity cubes is called correlation.
2 ways 	1. configuration based
		2.	Rule Based

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Provisioning ?

Process of adding entitlement to an identity on the target system is called provisioning.
note: Entitlement = access/groups/permisson

Deprovisioning?

Process of removing entitlement to an identity on the target system is called Deprovisioning.


Access Reuqest?
It gives the tracking information for raised Request.

MyWork-->Access Request

Above access Access Request is in pending for manager approval (Workitem is in open state waiting for manager approval)
MyWork --> Workitems


Requester : The person who places the request.

Requstiee : The person to whom raquest placed for.

Connected Applications and Disconnected Applications

Connector Types
	1. Connected applications

	connected Applications (this connector supports provison to the target System)
	Example: LDAP, Active Directory, Salesfor
	When you try to add an entitlement, connector adds entitlement automatically since it is connected application.
	When you try to remove an entitlement, connector remove entitlement automcatically since its is connected application.


	2. Disconnected Applications
	Disconnected Applications (this connector doesn't upports provison to the target System)
	Example: Delimeted File Connector
	When you try to add an entitlement, connector can't add entitlement automatically since it is disconnected application. someone has to add entitlement manually.
	When you try to remove an entitlement, connector can't remove entitlement automcatically since its is disconnected application.	someone has to remove entitlement manually.

	Note: For disconnected applications, SailPoint IIQ will create a manual workitem. someone has to complete manual work item once entitlement add/remove completes in the source applicaiton.

Groups, Populations and workgroups
--------------------------------------
Groups and populations are used to provide sets of identities to include in various activities
We can do refresh only for members of a group or workgroup
We can do certification for members of a group or workgroup
We can also use as a report as well
Group :
Groups are based on single search crieteria.
for example location, manger, status (single search criteria)

Active Managers who are not Contractors in Asia-Pacific Region only - as this as 3 filters we can't create a group but we can create a population.
Population:
Populations are multiple search crieteria based set of identities.
Active Managers who are not Contractors in Asia-Pacific Region only
Differences betwenn groups and populations?
roups are based on single search crieteria where as Populations are multiple search crieteria based .
	
Roles (Bundle) - RBAC (Role Based Access Control)
--------------------------------------------------
Roles(Bundles): Through roles, system entitlements can be grouped together and represent as a single unit.
or
set of Entitlements 
or
A role is a collection of permissions, and users receive permissions through the roles they have been assigned. 


Why We need Roles?
Ans. To automate provisioning process.


By default, there are four different types of roles present in IDentity IQ.

1. organisation roles
2. Bussiness roles/Assigned Roles
3. IT Roles/Detected roles
4. Entitlement Roles


1.	Organizational:
----------------------------
organize the roles in the IdentityIQ UI for easier management
organisational roles is to create Folders.

2.	Business(Assigned Role)
----------------------------
identify job functions or titles or other attributes by which users can be grouped
3.	IT(Detected Role)
----------------------------
encapsulate sets of system entitlements
4.	Entitlement(Detected Role)
----------------------------
represent individual system entitlements



Business role (Assigned Role)
-------------------
Business role: assignable role (with an assignment rule) which can contain required and permitted roles 
but do not contain direct entitlements

-->generally represent job functions, titles, or responsibilities.
Job Functions : GIS Mapping, Youtube Content Verify, 
Bussiness_Role_GIS_Mapping
Bussiness_Role_Youtube_Content_Verify
BussinesRole_Manager
BussinessRole_Supervisior
Treasury Analyst” 
“Accounts Payable Clerk”

Business roles are assigned to users directly, 
either automatically via attribute matching based on on things like job title or department, or via request.



IT role (Detected Role)
-------------------
IT role: role with an entitlement profile which can be used for role detection and for provisioning;
 these are not assignable by default and therefore contain no assignment rules
 
 what is profiles ?
 
 entitlements within an IT Role is called profile.
 
-->IT Roles encapsulate sets of system entitlements. They are tied to actual permissions within an application
 or target system.
-->A user’s IT roles can be detected in IdentityIQ based on the entitlements that user has. 
Access can also be provisioned in IdentityIQ via IT roles.

-->IT roles are connected to business roles through the Required Roles and Permitted Roles.
Required Roles
---------------
A business role’s Required Roles are the IT roles that an Identity must have when they are associated with that business role.
Permitted Roles
---------------
A business role’s Permitted Roles are the IT roles that an Identity can have but is not required to have when assigned that business role


What is RBAC?
--------------
RBAC - Role Based Access Control
-One of the main goals of RBAC is to grant employees only the access they need to do their jobs, and to prevent them from having access that is not relevant to them

Use Cases;
->Role Provisioning 
	We have raised manual Requet
->Role Deprovisioning
	We have raised manula Request
->Automatic Provisioning 
	We have to define Assignment Rule( Match List / Script / Rule /Filer)
	Should run the Refresh Task with enabling following options
	i. Refresh assigned, detected roles and promote additional entitlements - ONly assigns Bussines Role but dont provision
	ii. Provision assignments - to provision entitlements
	
	
	if status is contractor = we have to create PRISM Account, groups = user
	if status is employees = we have to create PRISM Account , groups = user, manager

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


CERTIFICATION = Access Review
---------------
user	=	not a risk entitlement, he can only look his account, dont have access to check others accounts
manger	=	medium risk entitlement, he can look his sub ordinates accounts  
super	= 	High Risk Entitlement, He can modify all accounts in the organisation

So certifications are used to review user access

Definiation : Reviewing user's access/entitlements is called certification(Access Review)
or 
Reviewing users entitlements is called certification (Access Review)
					
					
--> Two catagories 
  1. Periodic Certifications (Based on Frequency Weekly, Monthly, Anually )
  2. Contineous Certification (Always runs )
  
  Certification Life Cycle
  
  1. Generation 		: During Generation Cetifications will generate. we have to specify what to certify, when to certify and who should certify.
  2. Staging phase 		: This is a optional phase, We can enable or disable Staging Period. It allows us to preview or check certification.  
  3. Active phase 		: During Active phase, Certifier will review the access. If Certifier finds access is appropriate, he will approve the access. If certifier finds access is inappropriate, he will revoke the access. 
  4. challenge			: challenging the decision. This is optional phase. We didn't configure in our project. we can challeng the decision.
  5. Revocation phase/	
	 Remediation Phase 	: Revocations will complete in Remediation phase.

------------------------
----> Certification LIfe Cycle
1. Generation (Configuraiton of certificaiton definition and all)
2. Staging  (To Review how certification is generated)
3. Active Period (Certifer will take appropriate decision, May approve or revoke )
4. Challenge Period (challenging the decision, )
5. Signoff (Once all decisions are completed reviwer has to Signoff)
6. Remediation/Revocation  (Entitlement Revocation will happen)



--> Types of Certification
1. Manager Certification - Manger will review his direct reports wheather they have proper access or not? { Certifier/Reviewer = Manager }
2. Application Owner Certification - App Owner will review all the accounts from that application. { certifier/Reviewer = Application Owner}
3. Entitlement Owner Certification - Entitlement Owner Will review/certifiy the user access. { Certifier/Reviewer = Entitlement Owner} 

4. Advanced Certification - Allows for creation of custom certifications based on Groups or Populations. {Certifier = Group Owner} 
5. Role Membership Certification - Role Owner Will review/certifiy the user access. { Certifier = role Owner}
6. Account Group Permissions - To Review the permissions of an Account Group.

--->Generation Of Certification(Access Reviews)
1.Basic			-	The Basic page allows the administrator to name Certification
					set owner name 
					What to certifiy 
					when to certifiy
2.Lifecycle		-	
3.Notifications	-	
4.Behavior		-
5.Advanced		-

Staging
---------------------------
--> Once Certification enter into staging you can't edit certificaiton.
--> Staging period is to review how certifiction looks?

Active Period
-----------------------------
-->ONce certifier signoff you can't change your decision
--> Reassignment : Once Access Review(Certification)  reassigned original Reviewer can't take any decision
					there will be no work item once certificaiton is reassigned
--> Delegation   : Once Access Review(Certification)  delegated original Reviewer can take any decision, original review's decision is the final decision.
					Even Access Review delegated still original reviewer can see certification items.
-->Escalation : When Origianl reviewer doesn't take any decision for number of days, that access review will be escalated as per the configuration 

---> PreDelegation : Certifcation will be delegated to the another reviwer as part of certification generation.

	
Life Cycle events : 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joiner 	: an employee who joined organisation.
Leaver	: an employee who leaves organisation.
Mover	: an employee who moves between deparments or change in his role.
Rehire	: an employee who is going to rejoin the same organisation is called Rehire.	

when life cycle events will trgger in SailPoint?
when we run refresh identity cube task with options "proces events" and "provisioining assignments".

When will joiner life cycle event will trigger?
when an identitycube cretes for the first time in the identityWarehouse will trigger the Joiner Life Cycle event in the next Identity Refresh Task.

mostly we use Joiner LIfe Cycle event to create Accounts on the Different Target Systems.

When will leaver life cycle event will trigger?
when an identitycube's identityAttribute inactive changes from false to true, then Leaver Life Cycle event will trgger in in the next Identity Refresh Task.

Mostly we use Leaver Life Cycle Event to Disable/Delete accounts on the Different Target Systems.

When will Rehire life cycle event will trigger?
when an identitycube's identityAttribute inactive changes from true to false, then Rehire Life Cycle event will trgger in in the next Identity Refresh Task.

Mostly we use Rehire Life Cycle Event to Enable accounts on the Different Target Systems.

When will Mover life cycle event will trigger?
When there is a change in Identity's department or jobtile or role then Mover life cycle event will trigger. we will configure required changes to the user accounts in the Target System.


What is Business Process/Workflow?
TBA

Right 		-	These rights control access on the SailPoint UI.
SailPoint object name SPRight
Capability 	-	We can define Capability as set of SPRights.
SailPoint object name is Capability
				viewAdminConsole has three rights (task, provisioning and environment)
Workgroup	-	We can define Workgroup as set of Capabilites and set of identities.
